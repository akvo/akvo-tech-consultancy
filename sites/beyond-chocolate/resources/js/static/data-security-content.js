            <p className="text-justify">
                The tool developer Akvo does not claim any data ownership. All data that will be collected through the system, will be legally owned by the organisations that enter the data. All rights remain with the organisations to whom the data belong. Akvo systems allow the administration of specified roles and permissions; with corresponding access to data and/or functionalities in the system. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Considering the potential broadening of the system over time, we envisage separate meetings to clarify roles and responsibilities across various stakeholders and clear guidelines and data procedures to administer and implement these roles and corresponding access to data and/or functionalities in the system.

            <h4>Data security & privacy</h4>

                Akvo maintains strong data security and privacy protection policies, frameworks, and procedures. Data is stored securely; we ensure data is safely encrypted, and your data is never shared with third parties. ​Imported data is owned by you.

            <p className="text-justify">
                Akvo software ensures that all data is properly secured when in transit and at rest. For data at rest, Akvo relies on the capabilities of Amazon S3 and Google Datastore, which provide one of the highest security standards in the whole industry. Data is backed-up regularly and stored securely on Google Cloud Storage. For data in transit, all communications between different parts of Akvo’s systems (Browser apps, mobile app, backend services, databases) are encrypted using TLS.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Any communication to Akvo’s backend service is properly authenticated and authorized. Akvo software gives administrators the control on what permissions a user has on the platform at a very fine level. All Akvo’s servers are managed by Google which are ISO certified, comply with US and EU regulations and provide round-the-clock security maintenance and essential upgrades for the best level of security. Akvo’s tools are continuously monitored for uptime.

            <h4>Roles and permissions</h4>
            <p className="text-justify">
                The platform secretariats of Beyond Chocolate, SWISSCO and GISCO will follow a roles and permissions model, allowing for administrator level and also granular access control to data. Access to questions and attendant response data will be restricted to a user’s specific and defined role and the permissions assigned to that role. A strict permissions model ensures that sensitive data is not accessible nor visible to other users of the platforms.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise by the owner of the data, collected data must be entirely anonymized and aggregated before they may be shared with other Members of the platforms and/or rendered public. Any data shared and/or displayed at a disaggregated level internally (e.g. to staff of the secretariats, the platform working groups that accompany the monitoring incl. data evaluation) will be entirely anonymized. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
                Before publishing (anonymized and aggregated) findings or insights arising from the analysis of collected data, the platform secretariats will still ensure that this does not indirectly disclose sensitive information with respect to a particular Member.

            <p className="text-justify">
                Access to data before anonymization is possible only for a very limited number of duly authorized persons having signed non-disclosure commitments; this may solely be done to check for and ensure consistency in data;  getting back to the members to correct for erroneous or contradicting data and/or for providing support to gradual improvement of sustainability reporting by Members.
