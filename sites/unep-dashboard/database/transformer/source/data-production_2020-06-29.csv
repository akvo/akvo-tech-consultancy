At its fourteenth meeting held in May 2019, in its decision BC-14/13, the COP decided to update the technical guidelines on plastic wastes and established a small intersessional working group. The group is led by China, Japan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and consists of experts nominated by Parties and others. The group will prepare draft updated technical guidelines for consideration at the twelfth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel Convention to be held in June 2020. A further revised version will then be considered at the fifteenth meeting of the COP to be held in May 2021 for possible adoption.  The technical guidelines include the following:  • Sources of plastic waste (pre-user and post-user)  • Environmentally sound and safe handling, compaction, transport, storage and shipping of plastic waste  • Health and safety issues  • Fire safety  • Second life applications for plastics material  • Energy recovery from plastic waste  • Final disposal of plastic waste  • Technical guidelines on the environmentally sound management of plastic-coated cables scrap  "	"LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments."

This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during the fishing and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in the Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split, one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs, such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland."

One of the aims was to investigate, through the pilot projects, the feasibility of developing this scheme and to prepare guidelines. The implementation in two fishing ports Hvar and Tribunj show a strong fishermen willingness to collaborate, being aware of their unique role in the active removal of litter from the sea. However, due to a lack of an overarching National law addressing marine litter management, its legal status was not defined. Existing Law on Sustainable Waste Management do not specifies how to handle with the litter collected. More should be in a separate regulation that applies only to marine litter, but it has not been adopted to the present days. Thus, marine litter was temporarily classified as urban waste by the hosting Municipalities and the municipal waste management company was in charge of disposal. Ffl activity can be easily implemented in Croatia, but is necessary to improve the legislation about marine litter, to examine deficiencies and gaps in these policies, and suggesting options for improvement."	2020-01-14 12:48:24 UTC	2020-01-14 13:33:37 UTC545728-545719-53855495	UNEP	On behalf of an organisation		UNEP Law Division	Yes	1	"legislative guidance to countries on marine litter, microplastics and single-use plastics"	legislative assistance to countries	"LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments."

The project allows to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air, water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover, the project will hold different competitions, trainings and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about adverse effect of improper waste handling.

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  o	The project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  o	The project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  o	The project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).   o	In Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector."

Race for Water Foundation promotes the review of current methods in place for plastic production and urge everyone to reduce their plastic consumption and recycle their plastic waste. But the fragility of the current recycling model hinders its development.    In anticipation of a circular plastic economy that is sustainable and environmentally friendly, Race for Water presents a realistic solution that, deployed on a large scale, can reduce drastically the contamination of the oceans from plastic waste. We offer high temperature pyrolysis technology developed to transform all plastic waste into electricity.  These units installed in containers can be installed close to inhabited areas and allow even isolated communities, such as islands, to manage their waste management and their energy  production independently. The income generated by the sale of electricity provides a source of remuneration to pay street collectors and a reduction in waste disposal costs. The value  generated directly benefits local communities, be it on an economic, social or environmental level.    We currently have a showroom in France where interested stakeholders can discover the unit in operation.   At the same time, a series of “Proof of Concept” projects are currently under study to showcase the business model, the social benefits and the positive environmental impact of the plastic waste to energy value chain in strategic places: islands, rivers and coastal cities.    By 2025, we are keen for our model to be replicated worldwide so as to have a sustainable impact on the planet."	2020-01-27 10:00:30 UTC	2020-01-27 11:12:43 UTC545728-545719-54310946	Ecoocean	On behalf of an organisation		Ecoocean	Yes	3	National Campaign	"Media campaign: Single Use Plastic Not on my Beach (Video clip, posts, etc.)  Signage, beach cleaning  and awareness activities: 15 municipalities: 10,000 identified participants  Advancing municipality bylaws forbidding single use plastic on beaches: one city (Eilat) passed the law, more to come.

Closing the Loop Regional Policy Guide and City Case Studies on reducing the environmental impact of cities in terms of marine litter"	"Arising from the increasing concern about plastic waste contaminating the natural environment in Asia and the Pacific, ESCAP brings together city actors to highlight associated opportunities for fostering a more inclusive, circular waste management system to address plastic waste pollution. In partnership with cities, the private sector, informal waste worker cooperatives and regional thought leaders, ESCAP encourages more sustainable consumption practices to return plastic resources to the production cycle; reduce plastic waste leakage into the environment and the oceans; and helps contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ESCAP provides a vital role in supporting capacity building initiatives with local and national governments to promote more circular waste economies.     The project developed and applied an assessment of plastic waste value chains to identify where different actors’ contributions intersect and several potential leakages of plastic waste that contribute to marine litter debris in partnership with waste cooperatives and local governments as well as Stockholm Environment Institute, Asia Centre. A longer term Phase II of the project is currently being designed.

Key achievements of the project included:    1. Improved the capacities of over 100 key waste actors in the cities of Pune and Bangkok to integrate the role of informal waste pickers into city wide plastic waste management approaches.    2. Strengthened evidence base through data profiling of the plastic waste value chain in Pune and Bangkok, driven by youth, women and informal waste worker mappers in communities based on a unique assessment methodology of the environmental contributions of informal waste pickers.  The profiling produced primary data on the informal plastic waste system and supported community organization and mobilized for regular engagement with local authorities aimed at more equitable waste service delivery outcomes. City case studies are being produced which capture the knowledge from this achievement.      3. Design of an inclusive plastic waste management capacity development approach which is being developed into a regional guidance document which is able to leverage a multiyear plan of targeted capacity development for local and national government staff in new cities and countries in Asia and the Pacific.

The project will leverage COBSEA intergovernmental mechanisms and engage COBSEA focal agencies with a strong marine focus to enable government partners in target countries to bridge existing policy gaps and address upstream sources of pollution.    The project has four components:   Output 1: Identify and develop market-based solutions towards ‘less plastic wasted’ to promote transformational changes in plastic management. Using a Circular Economy approach, this includes creating business incentives for plastic reduction and recycling that increase plastic re-use and recovery and reduce single-use plastic products.    Output 2: Strengthen the scientific basis for informed decision-making to address marine plastic litter, by building national and regional capacities, and generating and disseminating data and information products, coherent methodologies, indicator frameworks and reporting processes/systems, in line with global best practice. Building on intergovernmental COBSEA mechanisms, the project will assist government partners to assess, develop and implement strategies and plans to address plastic pollution holistically from ‘source to sea’ and collect findings of plastic hotspots in the environment to monitor progress of upstream efforts to reduce leakage.    Output 3: Create widespread outreach on marine litter and plastic pollution to raise awareness of marine litter and of solutions for better plastic value chain management, to promote behavioural change among consumers and in the industry and create an enabling space for policy development. This will involve regional constituency engagement and knowledge exchange, targeted outreach campaigns and linking to global campaigns (e.g. Clean Seas).    Output 4: Regional networking will establish the necessary mechanisms for technical advice and exchange, facilitating dialogue and networking and provide targeted capacity building and technical support. The project will support implementation of regional frameworks –such as the COBSEA Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter (RAP MALI) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Framework of Action on Marine Debris—and improve coordination among actors, including finance institutions and international and regional organizations engaged in developing plastic pollution and waste management systems. This component will leverage regional efforts, including through ASEAN-led mechanisms and working groups, to share knowledge and coordinate efforts in the region for a holistic whole-of-value-chain approach.

The data collected provide powerful insights into the problem; aiming to inspire action and empower decision-making for a litter-free Aotearoa.  To collect litter data long-term, the charity group provides communities with free training, equipment and technology to take part as ‘Citizen Scientists’. Since trainings began in October 2018, litter monitoring sites have been set-up at 106 beaches around Aotearoa and 1 in Samoa in collaboration with the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme.   This year’s Colmar Brunton Better Futures Report called build-up of plastic in the environment “The headline issue for New Zealanders”, with 72% of respondents concerned about this issue; higher than all other social and environmental issues surveyed. This widespread concern has sparked communities into action.  “People want to be a part of the solution,” says Sustainable Coastlines Co-Founder Camden Howitt. “Clean-ups are a popular way for groups to address the issue locally. Litter Intelligence brings in science to make clean-ups more effective long-term. By contributing high quality, scientific data, Citizen Scientists can prove which litter problems affect them the most, helping individuals, communities, businesses and governments to solve them.”  The programme’s powerful digital tools and its simple but rigorous United Nations Environment Programme methodology enable Litter Intelligence data to meet the highest standard required for government environmental reporting; a first for citizen science in New Zealand. Having recently been awarded a coveted AI for Earth grant from Microsoft, the charity is now working to integrate artificial intelligence and other smart technologies to provide an even stronger understanding of litter solutions.  The Litter Intelligence website makes all litter data, insights and ‘Action Stories’ free and open for all. “Technology gives us the tools to make environmental data accessible and understandable by everyone,” says Project Manager and Development Lead Dr Sandy Britain. “This gives students and scientists, politicians and business leaders, writers and researchers the right information to take action for a litter-free Aotearoa.”  Although still in its early days, Litter Intelligence has already gained international attention. The charity presented the programme at the Fourth United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi in March 2019 and trained Citizen Scientists during the Pacific Environment Forum in Apia, Samoa in September 2019.

Accessed 29 Jan 2020						"The 'Second HELCOM Holistic Assessment of Ecosystem Health in the Baltic Sea' that was carried out by HELCOM through the HELCOM HOLAS II project reflects the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea for the period 2011–2016. The assessment covers the whole Baltic Sea marine region and provides information on the overall environmental status of and pressures on the Baltic Sea as well as social and economic aspects that are linked to the status of the Sea and the human activities impacting upon it. In June 2017 the assessment was published under the title ‘State of the Baltic Sea report, June 2017’, containing, for the first time in a regional assessment, a descriptive section on marine litter (since there is no core indicators on marine litter). The section on marine litter was updated as part of the update of the report concluded in June 2018 (‘State of the Baltic Sea – Second HELCOM holistic assessment 2011-2016’), thus the final version includes information on: (i) litter items found on beaches, per sub-basin, grouped by material (plastics, metal, glass/ceramics, paper/cardboard, processed/worded wood, rubber, cloth/textile and unclassified); (ii) litter items found on different types of beaches, categorized into urban, peri-urban and rural beaches, again grouped by material; (iii) the ten most frequent litter items at Baltic Sea level at the different types of beaches; and (iv) the proportion of marine litter material categories in bottom trawl hauls for sub-basins covered by the Baltic International Trawl Survey coordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).

The operation was based on three major observations:  •	Plastic is a form of pollution to be reduced;  •	Digital platforms are a key vector of awareness;  •	Young people are the primary target audience.    These observations have been translated into concrete challenges and indicators for all stakeholders. Therefore, three key events took place to sensitize beach visitors as part of this operation with the objective of mobilizing 1 Million young people around 10,000 actions to achieve 10 tons less of plastic waste per beach. 63 local communities supported by the DGCL, 27 economic partners and more than a hundred local associations were mobilized for nearly three months to educate and raise awareness of beach users, monitor the bathing water and sand quality, equip beaches, ensure safety, enforce order and regulations. On May 20, 2019, the Foundation organized a coordination meeting a few weeks before the launching of the 2019 the Plastic Free Beaches Action, in order to:  •	Update on the upcoming operation;  •	Present recent actions undertaken by the Foundation.  •	Agree on a coordinated approach.  •	Choose the theme of the operation, to allow optimal coordination. The operation was named: #b7arblaplastic.  •	Devise a long term objective    For each event, an action shared by all the partners on the targeted beaches was organzed to reinforce the visibility of the operation. The first key event “Together for 10 tons less of plastic waste per beach,” took place over the summer months. Each targeted beach was paired with an economic partner responsible for carrying out activities to promote clean beaches by organizing clean up actions or actions mobilizing holidaymakers, especially children. These activities weighed the amount of the collected plastic waste at the level of all participating beaches resulting in the collection of 486.4 tons plastic waste.  The second key event challenged all partners to conduct environmental awareness and educative actions and activities to reduce the production of plastic waste, such as spending a day on the beach without a plastic bag. The third and final event was the participation of the  Plastic Free Beaches Action at the World Clean Up Day. This international event organized by the United Nations to bring together 18 million people in 157 countries for the largest waste collection day ever.  By setting up these three key events during the summer, the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection aimed, with the help of its multiple partners, to raise awareness among Moroccan citizens regarding the reduction of plastic waste, which is extremely harmful to our environment and biodiversity. Using less plastics, buying less plastic packaged products and stopping plastic litter are simple actions that can help preserve the nature we all depend on.    Key strengths  •	A key hashtag “#b7arblaplastic” (#PlasticFreeBeach) accompanied the operation to further communicate the overall objective to the public. Operation #b7arblaplastic was launched on June 10 on all targeted beaches by the Clean Beaches program.  •	As part of the clean beaches operation and #b7arblaplastic operation, a recycling project was initiated at Mehdia Beach. The project consisted of raising awareness and animating actions for the selective collection, sorting, and weighing of plastic waste. Thanks to the collaboration of ONEE, SOREPAC, the recycling company, as well as the CSSF association that promotes education among rural girls, plastic food bottles were collected by SOREPAC that doubled the purchase price in favor of the CSSF. (2DH / KG) The profits from this action were used to donate computer equipment, bicycles and other useful items to contribute to digitization of rural schools, which allows students to connect to different platforms to access information, awareness and training on themes directly related to sustainable development. The aim of this action is to be implemented continuously with the aim of avoiding the negative impact of marine plastic pollution.  •	The impact of this operation has been amplified through the Foundation’s various programs, which have successfully launched a call for action in this campaign, including:   -	Young Reporters for the Environment (YRE): 30 videos were made by the YRE on the ground.   -	Eco-Schools: schools shared posters on their social media.   -	Green Key: 5 beach hotels displayed the posters on their sites and on their digital platforms. Several awareness-raising actions were carried out for staff and clients.  •	A pertinent communication plan accompanied this project and continued throughout the campaign.  -	Four visuals (in Arabic and French) were designed for the beaches and published at the initiative of the economic partners during the summer of 2019.  -	A TV commercial (spot) has been broadcast on national channels.  -	Awareness messages have been broadcast on the radio. To reach public opinion, dialectal Arabic has been used.  -	Communication materials adapted to digital platforms have been developed.  -	Economic partners and influencers have been mobilized to publish these materials on their social media pages.    Results    As a result, more than 400 publications linked to the operation on social networks reached around 600,000 people. Around 1’400’000 engaged people, namely youth, collected 486.4 tons of plastic waste on 70 beaches, i.e. 8 tons of plastic waste were avoided per beach. 49’531 actions were carried out jointly for the benefit of holidaymakers; awareness raising actions on plastic pollution, cleaning actions and fun activities.

By overlaying GIS data the study was able to investigate potential correlations and analyse various environmental, health, and demographic data to evaluate issues of poverty and gender as they may be related to incidence of disease and risk. This study revealed that there was a relationship between the cases of ZikV and marine debris density, especially of large marine debris (i.e. tires). These results also suggest that coastal communities may want to prioritize clean up of large marine debris to limit the habitat for Aedes aegypti habitat and subsequent ZikV transmission"	"MONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

By buying more sustainable products and services, corporate buyers in the tourism sector can convey a strong market signal and help drive markets towards more sustainability.         Following up the interactive workshop “Leveraging sustainable procurement practices to transform tourism value chains” which took place in October 2018, UN Environment has documented successful sustainable procurement practices in a series of 16 case studies. They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics."
