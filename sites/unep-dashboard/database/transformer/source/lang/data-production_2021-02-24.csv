At its fourteenth meeting held in May 2019,  in its decision BC-14/13,  the COP decided to update the technical guidelines on plastic waste and established a small intersessional working group. The group is led by China,  Japan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and consists of experts nominated by Parties and others. The group will prepare draft updated technical guidelines for consideration at the twelfth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Basel Convention to be held in June 2020. A further revised version will then be considered at the fifteenth meeting of the COP to be held in May 2021 for possible adoption. The technical guidelines include the following:  • Sources of plastic waste (pre-user and post-user)  • Environmentally sound and safe handling,  compaction,  transport,  storage and shipping of plastic waste  • Health and safety issues  • Fire safety  • Second life applications for plastics material  • Energy recovery from plastic waste  • Final disposal of plastic waste  • Technical guidelines on the environmentally sound management of plastic-coated cables scrap  LEGISLATION,  STANDARDS,  RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with,  new regulation,  agreements,  policies,  economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments.Policy change or development, New standard(s) or guideline(s)TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g.,  research and development,  new product design,  new materials,  processes etc.),  changes in practice,  operations,  environmental management and planningOtherWe are supporting parties and others,  to update the technical guidelines as the Secretariat of the Basel Convention and requested by the COP decision.PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),  PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANISATION (for-profit organisations run by individuals and groups,  free from government ownership),  THIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations,  including charity groups,  community groups etc),  OtherThe technical guidelines if adopted at the COP of the Basel Convention will become a reference standard agreed at the international level for the environmentally sound management of plastic wastes,  but it is not mandatory to any stakeholder to follow it.

As an individualYes1Fishing for LitterFisheries is a sector that can make a significant contribution to solving the problem of marine litter,  by participating in its removal through the "Fishing for Litter" (FfL) initiative. This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during fishing,  and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO,  dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split,  one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands,  Denmark,  Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs,  such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland.WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmesAwareness raising and Behaviour change, Education/Training, WorkshopsInformation campaign, Behaviour change campaign/programme, Community Engagement, Stakeholder EngagementOther training programmes, Institutional developmentLEGISLATION,  STANDARDS,  RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with,  new regulation,  agreements,  policies,  economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments, MONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

The project will initiate waste sorting and recycling activities in the capital Yerevan and select village communities,  foster new business opportunities in the waste management industry,  increase public awareness of recycling and reuse,  promote environmental education. Through the SGP grant funding,  ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools,  universities,  organizations,  companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic,  paper,  glass,  and metallic waste,  which will be transported to the recycling sites.  The project aims to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting the recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to the reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air,  water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover,  the project will hold different competitions,  training and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about the adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g.,  research and development,  new product design,  new materials,  processes etc.) changes in practice,  operations,  environmental management and planning.Change in practiceWORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmes)ImplementerTHIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations,  including charity groups,  community groups etc).Community based organisationYesThere is a mandatory reporting mechanismYesNational ArmeniaUrban environment, Waste disposal sitesCollection / sorting of plastics after use, Management of collected plasticsReducing plastics, Recycling plasticsHuman health and wellbeingNot applicableOtherWaste50000USD16730USDMixedGEF SGPContinuous activity more than 3 Years longhttps://www.facebook.com/issdngo/http://www.slaq.am/arm/news/1262611/https://econews.am/?p=10501&l=am https://bit.ly/2rV0bBahttps://bit.ly/2QSJPbchttps://bit.ly/2DRdclU 2020-01-23 20:24:56 UTC2020-01-23 20:40:49 UTC

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions,  in particular plastics,  and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment,  by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  *	The project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo,  CHU JRB Befelatanana,  currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  *	The project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious,  rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs,  including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam,  and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  *	The project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company,  Waste Master (Z),  currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka,  University Teaching Hospital (UTH),  Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).  *	In Zambia,  the project also initiated a demonstration activity,  as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste,  on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka,  but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g.,  research and development,  new product design,  new materials,  processes etc.) changes in practice,  operations,  environmental management and planning.Change in operationsWORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmes)ImplementerPUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes)National ministry/agencyYesReporting is voluntaryYesTransnational Ghana, Madagascar,United Republic of Tanzania,ZambiaUrban environment, Waste disposal sitesCollection / sorting of plastics after useRecycling plasticsHuman health and wellbeingNot applicableMedical6453195USD28936164USDNot applicableGEFContinuous activity more than 3 Years long2020-01-23 20:48:23 UTC2020-01-23 20:56:14 UTC

In partnership with cities,  the private sector,  informal waste worker cooperatives and regional thought leaders,  ESCAP encourages more sustainable consumption practices to return plastic resources to the production cycle; reduce plastic waste leakage into the environment and the oceans; and helps contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ESCAP provides a vital role in supporting capacity building initiatives with local and national governments to promote more circular waste economies.     The project developed and applied an assessment of plastic waste value chains to identify where different actors’ contributions intersect and several potential leakages of plastic waste that contribute to marine litter debris in partnership with waste cooperatives and local governments as well as the Stockholm Environment Institute,  Asia Centre.

Considering waste management systems in the region remain largely inadequate to process increasing amounts of plastic waste,  the project focuses on the lifecycle stages of (i) Production of plastic products,  (ii) Plastic use,  and (iii) Collection / sorting / recycling,  to ensure that less plastic is wasted and strategically prevent plastic litter entering the ocean. To achieve these objectives,  project partners include national and local government agencies; businesses,  producers,  retailers,  and associations in the packaging,  consumer and institutional products industry. To promote inclusive whole-of-value-chain planning at the national and regional level,  project activities will actively engage civil society,  consumers,  informal waste workers,  and communities most vulnerable to the impacts of marine litter.LEGISLATION,  STANDARDS,  RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with,  new regulation,  agreements,  policies,  economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments.Policy change or development, High-level strategy, Legislation or regulations, New standard(s) or guideline(s), Change in Taxes/Subsidies, Ban(s), Package of measures combining incentives and infrastructure (e.g. deposit reward schemes), OtherMarket-based incentivesWORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmes), TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g.,  research and development,  new product design,  new materials,  processes etc.),  changes in practice,  operations,  environmental management and planning, MONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

Plastics Smart promotes “the wise use of plastics” to prevent the generation of marine litter.   Clean Ocean Material Alliance: It has become necessary for society to promote worldwide efforts to overcome the marine plastic litter issue,  a newly emerging global challenge. To decrease such litter,  conducting appropriate control of waste is urgently needed,  including through thorough efforts for preventing littering,  further enhancement of the 3Rs (Reduce,  Reuse and Recycle) initiatives involving plastic products,  and further development and adoption of plastics with excellent biodegradability and materials alternative to plastics,  for e.g.,  paper.

Focusing on how to prevent the outflow of plastic litter to the ocean.  This action plan lists effective countermeasures to realise a world without additional pollution by plastic.    Japan also formulated the "Resource Circulation Strategy for Plastics" with the purpose of comprehensively promoting plastic resource circulation. The main focus includes thorough reduction; effective,  efficient and sustainable recycling; promotion of recycled materials and bioplastics use; marine plastic countermeasures; international deployment; and infrastructure development.   In addtion,  based on the amendment of the  Act on Promoting the Treatment of Marine Debris on 2018,  Japan changed the "Basic Policy based on the Act on Promoting the Treatment of Marine Debris". The new basic policy defines treatment of marine debris based on the idea of "basin area" and includes measures against microplastics.

In 2020 there are already about 300 member organisations in the BSC Network from the countries around the Baltic Sea. BSC is run by two big coastal cities in Finland,  Helsinki and Turku. In addition to inviting organizations to Baltic Sea protection work,  the cities themselves are committed to work for the Baltic Sea. The Joint Baltic Sea Action Plan of the cities of Helsinki and Turku 2019-2023 was published last year and it is the third of it's kind. Among the actions there some that especially target marine litter such as organizing annual beach cleaning events in collaborations with the cities of Tallinn and St. Petersburg and local actors.

Led by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in collaboration with UNEP,  the Global Commitment brings together and aligns the efforts of businesses,  governments,  and other organisations behind a common vision and targets,  to address plastic waste and pollution at its source. The Global Commitment aims to act as a lighthouse by suggesting specific actions designed with a systemic perspective for each actor in the plastics value chain,  enabling frontrunning businesses and governments to inspire others and lead by example. UNEP leads the engagement of governments under this Initiative. As of October 2019,  over 400 institutions have signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment,  including 19 governments from around the world,  and more than 200 businesses of the plastic packaging value chain (jointly representing over 20% of all plastic packaging used globally).

The project aimed at capitalizing on growing a baseline of knowledge on marine plastics sources,  pathways and environmental impacts,  to recommend actions to build circularity and reduce pollution for the plastic sector. Under this project,  a roadmap to circular economy for plastics was developed by UNEP in collaboration with partners. UNEP also developed a report to take stock of the extent of knowledge on plastics in marine environment,  a global plastic value chain mapping report and a to-be-published recommendations for action report. 2 multi-stakeholder consultation workshops were held by UNEP to map the plastic value chain and identify recommended actions towards a circular economy for plastics.

Puerto Rico was used to examine this relationship because the marine litter data was extensive and robust. By overlaying GIS data the study was able to investigate potential correlations and analyse various environmental,  health,  and demographic data to evaluate issues of poverty and gender as they may be related to incidence of disease and risk. This study revealed that there was a relationship between the cases of ZikV and marine debris density,  especially of large marine debris (i.e. tires). These results also suggest that coastal communities may want to prioritize the clean up of large marine debris to limit the habitat for Aedes aegypti habitat and subsequent ZikV transmissionMONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

A long-list of solutions has enabled the identification of hotspots,  and resource efficiency  indicators which were validated via the STAG and used as a key input for the identification  of priorities and development of the roadmaps and country action plans.  A series of workshops was organized to prioritize solutions and develop the roadmaps and  specifically,  to discuss feasibility,  and identify key stakeholders for synergies. Several steps  were taken to refine the shortlisted solutions,  such as in-country workshops and steering  committee meetings.  The project team worked with tourism stakeholders in the countries to identify  and develop three systemic solutions to address priority environmental impact hotspots  and develop the roadmap over an 18-month period.     https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/country-roadmapsLEGISLATION,  STANDARDS,  RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with,  new regulation,  agreements,  policies,  economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments.High-level strategy, New standard(s) or guideline(s)LEGISLATION,  STANDARDS,  RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with,  new regulation,  agreements,  policies,  economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitmentsDeveloperPUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes), PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANISATION (for-profit organisations run by individuals and groups,  free from government ownership).National ministry/agency, Sub-national ministry/agencyNational Corporation, Small-medium sized enterpriseYesThere is a mandatory reporting mechanismYesTransnational Dominican Republic, Mauritius, Philippines, Saint LuciaNot applicableProduction / Manufacture, Use / consumption, Management of collected plastics, Clean-up of plastic from the environmentReducing plastics, Reusing plastic, Recycling plasticsHuman health and wellbeing, Biodiversity, Food chainMacroplastic (large,  more than 20 mm,  e.g. plastic bottles), Microplastics (tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter,  e.g.,  found in personal care products/synthetic textiles)Bottles, Plastic bags, Food packaging (containers,  wrappers etc.), Non-food packaging (containers,  wrappers etc.), Cups (e.g.,  disposable coffee cups), Plastic straws,  stirrers,  cutleryMicrobeads used in cosmeticsTourism100000USDPublic FinancingGerman government- IKI fundsContinuous activity 1-3 Yearshttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/country-roadmapshttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/roadmap_dominican_republic_1.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/roadmap_for_low-carbon_and_resource-efficient_tourism_in_the_philippines_0.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/low_carbon_and_resource_efficient_action_plan_for_accommodation_in_saint_lucia_1.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/action_plan_for_low_carbon_and_resource_efficient_accommodation_in_mauritius_1.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/hoja_de_ruta_republica_dominicana_1.pdf2020-04-24 14:28:51 UTC2020-04-24 15:36:58 UTC

By buying more sustainable products and services,  corporate buyers in the tourism sector can convey a strong market signal and help drive markets towards more sustainability. Following up the interactive workshop “Leveraging sustainable procurement practices to transform tourism value chains” which took place in October 2018,  UN Environment has documented successful sustainable procurement practices in a series of 16 case studies. They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.  3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics.WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmesOtherCase studies and best practicesWORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmes)DeveloperPRIVATE SECTOR ORGANISATION (for-profit organisations run by individuals and groups,  free from government ownership).Small-medium sized enterpriseNoThere is no reporting mechanism, There is not enough resource to support reportingNoGlobal Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore, Viet NamNot applicableProduction / Manufacture, Use / consumption, Management of collected plasticsReducing plastics, Reusing plastic, Recycling plasticsBiodiversity, Marine organisms, Food chainMacroplastic (large,  more than 20 mm,  e.g. plastic bottles)Bottles, Plastic bags, Food packaging (containers,  wrappers etc.), Cups (e.g.,  disposable coffee cups), Plastic straws,  stirrers,  cutleryTourism10000USDPublic FinancingFrench and German governmentSingle eventhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/leveraging-procurement-tourismhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/replacing_single-use_plastic_bottles_in_asia.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/phasing_out_single-use_plastics_in_meetings_and_events_operations_1.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/reduction_of_single-use_plastics_in_the_hotel_industry_in_cyprus.pdfhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/case-studies-transforming-tourismhttps://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/resource/transforming-tourism-through-sustainable-procurement2020-04-24 16:08:55 UTC2020-04-24 16:22:06 UTC

This year,  we collected an estimated 90 tons of plastic litter in the Nkambe municipality and part of Misaje council area. These plastics consist mostly of whisky,  tomatoes and other plastic sachets below 60microns. They constitute the highest polluters in our communities given that it is cheap and accessible,  which are gradually turning our communities into plastic communities. The majority of them are transported by wind or streams for long distances. We were able to produce and plant 300.000 trees. To achieve this,  we got involved 60 youths in the chain from collection to sorting,  filling of sachets and planting of trees. Our next step is to generate enough funds from sales of trees to be able to acquire machines to recycle reused plastics to pavement bricks TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g.,  research and development,  new product design,  new materials,  processes etc.) changes in practice,  operations,  environmental management and planning.New product design, Change in practice, Change in operations, Different environmental management of land based environmentsWORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g.,  education,  training,  communication,  awareness raising,  behaviour change programmes)ImplementerTHIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations,  including charity groups,  community groups etc).Community based organisationYesReporting is voluntaryYesSub-national CameroonMountains and upland area, Agricultural land/soils, Entire water catchment, Forests or Mangroves, Freshwater rivers and lakes, Urban environment, Waste disposal sitesCollection / sorting of plastics after use, Management of collected plastics, Clean-up of plastic from the environmentReducing plastics, Reusing plastic, Recycling plasticsHuman health and wellbeing, Biodiversity, Marine organisms, Ecosystem Services, Food chainMicroplastics (tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter,  e.g.,  found in personal care products/synthetic textiles)Microplastics used in other products e.g. paintsPackaging, Agriculture, Food & Beverages, Wastewater/Sewage management4255USD1USDNot applicable, OtherSelf financing from sales of trees in our nursery Self financing from sales of trees Continuous activity more than 3 Years longhttps://www.facebook.com/yodo.cameroonhttps://www.oceanactionhub.org/organization/youth-development-organization-yodo-cameroonhttp://www.icameroon.com/2020/03/yodo-cameroon-empowers-youths-in-tree-planting/https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/reimagine-charitable-giving-challenge/ideas/plastic-waste-eradication-programme2020-12-15 07:29:59 UTC

During this short time,  the initiative has drawn national and international attention to the Tisza; activated thousands of volunteers; and has removed 120 tonnes of plastic and other sorts of contamination from the river. It has started as a trash-boat race,  with the simple goal of collecting as many plastics from the river as possible. The best boat was given a fancy award made of recycled plastic: the PLASTIC Cup (hence the name,  after one of the world's most prestigious boat races - the America's Cup). By now PLASTIC Cup has become an ongoing,  all-year-round series of events. Awareness raising campaigns,  exhibitions,  movie screenings,  public talks and clean-up actions make the volunteers busy. Experts,  researchers have joined the project and so the systematic monitoring of the plastic contamination started. In the meantime,  the good old boat race has not been forgotten. On the contrary,  it's more popular than ever before. Implementation is carried out on 3 levels.     ●	CLEANUPS ON LAND. Team building exercises,  small and large scale foodplain forest cleanups all year around for all age groups.  ●	CLEANUP ACTIONS ON WATER. Short and long distance boat races,  large scale interventions accomplished in cooperation with water authorities,  companies and local settlements.  ●	INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. Educational,  fundraising and awareness raising campaigns in upstream countries in order to reduce and wherever possible,  stop the pollution.
