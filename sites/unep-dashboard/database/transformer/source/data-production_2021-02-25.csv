",As an individual,,,Yes,1,Fishing for Litter,"Fisheries is a sector that can make a significant contribution to solving the problem of marine litter, by participating in its removal through the ""Fishing for Litter"" (FfL) initiative. This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during fishing, and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO, dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split, one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs, such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland.","WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes",,,"Awareness raising and Behaviour change, Education/Training, Workshops",,"Information campaign, Behaviour change campaign/programme, Community Engagement, Stakeholder Engagement",,"Other training programmes, Institutional development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments, MONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

Through the SGP grant funding, ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools, universities, organizations, companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic, paper, glass, and metallic waste, which will be transported to the recycling sites. The project aims to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting the recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to the reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air, water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover, the project will hold different competitions, training and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about the adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,Change in practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",Implementer,,"THIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations, including charity groups, community groups etc).",,,,,,Community based organisation,,Yes,There is a mandatory reporting mechanism,,,,Yes,,National (it covers one entire country),,Armenia,,"Urban environment, Waste disposal sites",,"Collection / sorting of plastics after use, Management of collected plastics",,"Reducing plastics, Recycling plastics",,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Other,Waste,50000,USD,16730,USD,Mixed,,GEF SGP,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,https://www.facebook.com/issdngo/,http://www.slaq.am/arm/news/1262611/,https://econews.am/?p=10501&l=am, https://bit.ly/2rV0bBa,https://bit.ly/2QSJPbc,https://bit.ly/2DRdclU ,2020-01-23 20:24:56 UTC,2020-01-23 20:40:49 UTC

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows: *	The project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics. *	The project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg). *	The project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg). *	In Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,Change in operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",Implementer,,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),,National ministry/agency,,,,,,Yes,Reporting is voluntary,,,,Yes,,"Transnational (several countries are involved, including bilateral)",,"Ghana, Madagascar,United Republic of Tanzania,Zambia",,"Urban environment, Waste disposal sites",,Collection / sorting of plastics after use,,Recycling plastics,,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Medical,,6453195,USD,28936164,USD,Not applicable,,GEF,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,,,,,,,2020-01-23 20:48:23 UTC,2020-01-23 20:56:14 UTC

In partnership with cities, the private sector, informal waste worker cooperatives and regional thought leaders, ESCAP encourages more sustainable consumption practices to return plastic resources to the production cycle; reduce plastic waste leakage into the environment and the oceans; and helps contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. ESCAP provides a vital role in supporting capacity building initiatives with local and national governments to promote more circular waste economies.   The project developed and applied an assessment of plastic waste value chains to identify where different actors’ contributions intersect and several potential leakages of plastic waste that contribute to marine litter debris in partnership with waste cooperatives and local governments as well as the Stockholm Environment Institute, Asia Centre. A longer term Phase II of the project is currently being designed.

This study revealed that there was a relationship between the cases of ZikV and marine debris density, especially of large marine debris (i.e. tires).

They illustrate how corporate buyers have effectively embedded sustainability in their procurement processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. 3 case studies are specifically focused on leveraging sustainable procurement to phase out single use plastics.","WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes",,,Other,Case studies and best practices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",Developer,,"PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANISATION (for-profit organisations run by individuals and groups, free from government ownership).",,,,Small-medium sized enterprise,,,,No,,,"There is no reporting mechanism, There is not enough resource to support reporting",,No,,"Transnational (several countries are involved, including bilateral)",,"Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Indonesia, Japan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Singapore, Viet Nam",,Not applicable,,"Production / Manufacture, Use / consumption, Management of collected plastics",,"Reducing plastics, Reusing plastic, Recycling plastics",,"Biodiversity, Marine organisms, Food chain",,"Macroplastic (large, more than 20 mm, e.g. plastic bottles)",,"Bottles, Plastic bags, Food packaging (containers, wrappers etc.), Cups (e.g., disposable coffee cups), Plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery",,,,Tourism,,10000,USD,,,Public Financing,,French and German government,Single event,,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/leveraging-procurement-tourism,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/replacing_single-use_plastic_bottles_in_asia.pdf,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/phasing_out_single-use_plastics_in_meetings_and_events_operations_1.pdf,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sites/default/files/reduction_of_single-use_plastics_in_the_hotel_industry_in_cyprus.pdf,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/case-studies-transforming-tourism,https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/resource/transforming-tourism-through-sustainable-procurement,2020-04-24 16:08:55 UTC,2020-04-24 16:22:06 UTC

This year, we collected an estimated 90 tons of plastic litter in the Nkambe municipality and part of Misaje council area. These plastics consist mostly of whisky, tomatoes and other plastic sachets below 60microns. They constitute the highest polluters in our communities given that it is cheap and accessible, which are gradually turning our communities into plastic communities. The majority of them are transported by wind or streams for long distances. We were able to produce and plant 300.000 trees. To achieve this, we got involved 60 youths in the chain from collection to sorting, filling of sachets and planting of trees. Our next step is to generate enough funds from sales of trees to be able to acquire machines to recycle reused plastics to pavement bricks ","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,"New product design, Change in practice, Change in operations, Different environmental management of land based environments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",Implementer,,"THIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations, including charity groups, community groups etc).",,,,,,Community based organisation,,Yes,Reporting is voluntary,,,,Yes,,Sub-national (it covers parts of one country),,Cameroon,,"Mountains and upland area, Agricultural land/soils, Entire water catchment, Forests or Mangroves, Freshwater rivers and lakes, Urban environment, Waste disposal sites",,"Collection / sorting of plastics after use, Management of collected plastics, Clean-up of plastic from the environment",,"Reducing plastics, Reusing plastic, Recycling plastics",,"Human health and wellbeing, Biodiversity, Marine organisms, Ecosystem Services, Food chain",,"Microplastics (tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, e.g., found in personal care products/synthetic textiles)",,,,Microplastics used in other products e.g. paints,,"Packaging, Agriculture, Food & Beverages, Wastewater/Sewage management",,4255,USD,1,USD,"Not applicable, Other",Self financing from sales of trees in our nursery ,Self financing from sales of trees ,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,https://www.facebook.com/yodo.cameroon,https://www.oceanactionhub.org/organization/youth-development-organization-yodo-cameroon,http://www.icameroon.com/2020/03/yodo-cameroon-empowers-youths-in-tree-planting/,https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/reimagine-charitable-giving-challenge/ideas/plastic-waste-eradication-programme,,,2020-12-15 07:29:59 UTC,

During this short time, the initiative has drawn national and international attention to the Tisza; activated thousands of volunteers; and has removed 120 tonnes of plastic and other sorts of contamination from the river. It has started as a trash-boat race, with the simple goal of collecting as many plastics from the river as possible. The best boat was given a fancy award made of recycled plastic: the PLASTIC Cup (hence the name, after one of the world's most prestigious boat races - the America's Cup). By now PLASTIC Cup has become an ongoing, all-year-round series of events. Awareness raising campaigns, exhibitions, movie screenings, public talks and clean-up actions make the volunteers busy. Experts, researchers have joined the project and so the systematic monitoring of the plastic contamination started. In the meantime, the good old boat race has not been forgotten. On the contrary, it's more popular than ever before. Implementation is carried out on 3 levels.   ●	CLEANUPS ON LAND. Team building exercises, small and large scale foodplain forest cleanups all year around for all age groups. ●	CLEANUP ACTIONS ON WATER. Short and long distance boat races, large scale interventions accomplished in cooperation with water authorities, companies and local settlements. ●	INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. Educational, fundraising and awareness raising campaigns in upstream countries in order to reduce and wherever possible, stop the pollution.
