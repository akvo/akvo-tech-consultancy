To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting , once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and nonfood production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group crops and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group livestock products. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. Indices which take into account deductions for feed and seed are referred to as \'\'net\'\'. Indices calculated without any deductions for feed and seed are referred to as \'\'gross\'\'.Theinternational commodity prices are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These international prices, expressed in so-calledinternational dollars, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single price to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Prices applied to meat in reality represent the prices of animals for slaughtering in terms of live weight. For example, if the price of one metric ton (1000 kg) of pigs alive is 825 dollars and the ratio meat to live weight is 75 to 100, the price applicable to 750 kg of pig meat will be 825 dollars, corresponding to 1100 dollars per metric tons.

Cyclone: Large-scale closed circulation system in the atmosphere above the Indian Ocean and South Pacific with low barometric pressure and strong winds that rotate clockwise. Maximum wind speed of 64 knots or more. Hurricane : Large-scale closed circulation system in the atmosphere above the western Atlantic with low barometric pressure and strong winds that rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Maximum wind speed of 64 knots or more.Storm: Wind with a speed between 48 and 55 knots.Tornado: Violently rotating storm diameter; the most violent weather phenomenon. It is produced in a very severe thunderstorm and appears as a funnel cloud extending from the base of a cumulonimbus to the ground.Tropical storm: Generic term for a non-frontal synoptic scale cyclone originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organised convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation.Typhoon : Large-scale closed circulation system in the atmosphere above the western Pacific with low barometric pressure and strong winds that rotate clockwise in ther southern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Maximum wind speed of 64 knots or more.Winter storm: Snow (blizzard), ice or sleet storm.', '#767ef8'),

Maps of individual islands for example, frequently show great detail, whereas regional maps summarize complex coastlines into a few simple lines. In addition, coastal features are constantly changing due to erosion, etc. The only way to derive comparable statistics on coastline length is to use a single source which uses a constant scale.

Because of the difficulty in trying to measure coastline length, these figures should be interpreted as approximations and should be used with caution. Coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 kilometers. The estimates presented here were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country\'s coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. In general, the coastline length of islands that are part of a country, but are not overseas territories, are included in the coastline estimate for that country (i.e., Canary Islands are included in Spain).
