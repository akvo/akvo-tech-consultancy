The project has four components:   Output 1: Identify and develop market-based solutions towards ‘less plastic wasted’ to promote transformational changes in plastic management. Using a Circular Economy approach, this includes creating business incentives for plastic reduction and recycling that increase plastic re-use and recovery and reduce single-use plastic products.    Output 2: Strengthen the scientific basis for informed decision-making to address marine plastic litter, by building national and regional capacities, and generating and disseminating data and information products, coherent methodologies, indicator frameworks and reporting processes/systems, in line with global best practice. Building on intergovernmental COBSEA mechanisms, the project will assist government partners to assess, develop and implement strategies and plans to address plastic pollution holistically from ‘source to sea’ and collect findings of plastic hotspots in the environment to monitor progress of upstream efforts to reduce leakage.    Output 3: Create widespread outreach on marine litter and plastic pollution to raise awareness of marine litter and of solutions for better plastic value chain management, to promote behavioural change among consumers and in the industry and create an enabling space for policy development.

The data collected provide powerful insights into the problem; aiming to inspire action and empower decision-making for a litter-free Aotearoa.  To collect litter data long-term, the charity group provides communities with free training, equipment and technology to take part as ‘Citizen Scientists’. Since trainings began in October 2018, litter monitoring sites have been set-up at 106 beaches around Aotearoa and 1 in Samoa in collaboration with the Secretariat for the Pacific Regional Environment Programme.   This year’s Colmar Brunton Better Futures Report called build-up of plastic in the environment “The headline issue for New Zealanders”, with 72% of respondents concerned about this issue; higher than all other social and environmental issues surveyed. This widespread concern has sparked communities into action.  “People want to be a part of the solution,” says Sustainable Coastlines Co-Founder Camden Howitt. “Clean-ups are a popular way for groups to address the issue locally. Litter Intelligence brings in science to make clean-ups more effective long-term. By contributing high quality, scientific data, Citizen Scientists can prove which litter problems affect them the most, helping individuals, communities, businesses and governments to solve them.”  The programme’s powerful digital tools and its simple but rigorous United Nations Environment Programme methodology enable Litter Intelligence data to meet the highest standard required for government environmental reporting; a first for citizen science in New Zealand. Having recently been awarded a coveted AI for Earth grant from Microsoft, the charity is now working to integrate artificial intelligence and other smart technologies to provide an even stronger understanding of litter solutions.  The Litter Intelligence website makes all litter data, insights and ‘Action Stories’ free and open for all. “Technology gives us the tools to make environmental data accessible and understandable by everyone,” says Project Manager and Development Lead Dr Sandy Britain. “This gives students and scientists, politicians and business leaders, writers and researchers the right information to take action for a litter-free Aotearoa.”  Although still in its early days, Litter Intelligence has already gained international attention.

The operation was based on three major observations:  •\\tPlastic is a form of pollution to be reduced;  •\\tDigital platforms are a key vector of awareness;  •\\tYoung people are the primary target audience.    These observations have been translated into concrete challenges and indicators for all stakeholders. Therefore, three key events took place to sensitize beach visitors as part of this operation with the objective of mobilizing 1 Million young people around 10,000 actions to achieve 10 tons less of plastic waste per beach. 63 local communities supported by the DGCL, 27 economic partners and more than a hundred local associations were mobilized for nearly three months to educate and raise awareness of beach users, monitor the bathing water and sand quality, equip beaches, ensure safety, enforce order and regulations. On May 20, 2019, the Foundation organized a coordination meeting a few weeks before the launching of the 2019 the Plastic Free Beaches Action, in order to:  •\\tUpdate on the upcoming operation;  •\\tPresent recent actions undertaken by the Foundation.  •\\tAgree on a coordinated approach.  •\\tChoose the theme of the operation, to allow optimal coordination. The operation was named: #b7arblaplastic.  •\\tDevise a long term objective    For each event, an action shared by all the partners on the targeted beaches was organzed to reinforce the visibility of the operation. The first key event “Together for 10 tons less of plastic waste per beach,” took place over the summer months. Each targeted beach was paired with an economic partner responsible for carrying out activities to promote clean beaches by organizing clean up actions or actions mobilizing holidaymakers, especially children. These activities weighed the amount of the collected plastic waste at the level of all participating beaches resulting in the collection of 486.4 tons plastic waste.  The second key event challenged all partners to conduct environmental awareness and educative actions and activities to reduce the production of plastic waste, such as spending a day on the beach without a plastic bag. The third and final event was the participation of the  Plastic Free Beaches Action at the World Clean Up Day. This international event organized by the United Nations to bring together 18 million people in 157 countries for the largest waste collection day ever.  By setting up these three key events during the summer, the Mohammed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection aimed, with the help of its multiple partners, to raise awareness among Moroccan citizens regarding the reduction of plastic waste, which is extremely harmful to our environment and biodiversity. Using less plastics, buying less plastic packaged products and stopping plastic litter are simple actions that can help preserve the nature we all depend on.    Key strengths  •\\tA key hashtag “#b7arblaplastic” (#PlasticFreeBeach) accompanied the operation to further communicate the overall objective to the public. Operation #b7arblaplastic was launched on June 10 on all targeted beaches by the Clean Beaches program.  •\\tAs part of the clean beaches operation and #b7arblaplastic operation, a recycling project was initiated at Mehdia Beach. The project consisted of raising awareness and animating actions for the selective collection, sorting, and weighing of plastic waste. Thanks to the collaboration of ONEE, SOREPAC, the recycling company, as well as the CSSF association that promotes education among rural girls, plastic food bottles were collected by SOREPAC that doubled the purchase price in favor of the CSSF. (2DH / KG) The profits from this action were used to donate computer equipment, bicycles and other useful items to contribute to digitization of rural schools, which allows students to connect to different platforms to access information, awareness and training on themes directly related to sustainable development. The aim of this action is to be implemented continuously with the aim of avoiding the negative impact of marine plastic pollution.  •\\tThe impact of this operation has been amplified through the Foundation’s various programs, which have successfully launched a call for action in this campaign, including:   -\\tYoung Reporters for the Environment (YRE): 30 videos were made by the YRE on the ground.   -\\tEco-Schools: schools shared posters on their social media.   -\\tGreen Key: 5 beach hotels displayed the posters on their sites and on their digital platforms. Several awareness-raising actions were carried out for staff and clients.  •\\tA pertinent communication plan accompanied this project and continued throughout the campaign.  -\\tFour visuals (in Arabic and French) were designed for the beaches and published at the initiative of the economic partners during the summer of 2019.  -\\tA TV commercial (spot) has been broadcast on national channels.  -\\tAwareness messages have been broadcast on the radio. To reach public opinion, dialectal Arabic has been used.  -\\tCommunication materials adapted to digital platforms have been developed.  -\\tEconomic partners and influencers have been mobilized to publish these materials on their social media pages.    Results    As a result, more than 400 publications linked to the operation on social networks reached around 600,000 people. Around 1’400’000 engaged people, namely youth, collected 486.4 tons of plastic waste on 70 beaches, i.e. 8 tons of plastic waste were avoided per beach. 49’531 actions were carried out jointly for the benefit of holidaymakers; awareness raising actions on plastic pollution, cleaning actions and fun activities.  ', '“Survey of polystyrene foam (EPS and XPS) in the Baltic Sea” - conducted by Denmark, the study gathers knowledge on the prevalence and sources of EPS in the Baltic Sea and suggests also possible measures to reduce the environmental load of EPS in the Baltic Sea. The study therefore involves all HELCOM countries and the results of the study will form the knowledge and decision-making basis for further work associated with the HELCOM Marine Litter Action Plan.   Two types of polystyrene foam, EPS and XPS (extruded polystyrene), are used for various purposes as further described in the report. As the two types are expected to behave similarly in the environment, the scope of the survey, originally focusing on EPS, has been extended to include both types.  ', 'Chapter 7 of the “Survey of polystyrene foam (EPS and XPS) in the Baltic Sea” identifies possible measures to reduce releases of EPS and XPS to the environment. A proposal for a prioritization of the proposed actions in the catalogue for regional implementation was first considered in autumn 2019 and will continue in spring 2020.', '“FanpLESStic-sea project – Initiatives to remove microplastics before they enter the sea” is an EU INTERREG Baltic Sea Region project aimed at decreasing and removing microplastics in the Baltic Sea (2019-2021). FanpLESStic-sea seeks to reduce microplastic leakage, by providing the following main outputs:   -\\tA model to map, understand and visualise microplastic pathways that will be applied to the partners’ cities/regions.   -\\tPiloting of new technology i) for filtering away microplastics; ii) sustainable drainage solutions as means for removal of microplastics; and iii) to remove microplastics from stormwater.   -\\tDefining innovative governance frameworks and engaging a large range of players for implementation of coordinated and cost-efficient measures resulting in locally adapted investment proposals/plans for each partner’s region.   -\\tDissemination of project results, including reports on barriers and ways forward, to increase institutional capacity on up-stream and problem-targeted methods to remove microplastics.

Further work is envisaged to develop a regional approach which would assist countries to handle the problem. Since the situation of ELB differs in the countries, the starting point to develop the regional approach would be a policy message based on the compiled material which, among other issues, identifies the roles of HELCOM, the EU and national governments in tackling the problem.', '“MARELITT Baltic – Reducing the impact of marine litter in the form of derelict fishing gear in the Baltic Sea”, and Interreg funded project concluded in 2018. The work conducted during three years has produced among other outputs the so called \"Baltic Sea Blueprint“, a report containing policy recommendations on mapping of hot spots on DFG, their retrieval, the management of the retrieved FG as well as preventive measures.', 'The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment released its first progress report in October 2019. This report provides an unprecedented level of transparency on how almost 200 businesses and governments are changing their plastic production and use to achieve this. The report shows that many business and government signatories have made initial progress against their targets — ranging from concrete plans to eliminate problematic packaging items, to reuse pilots, changes in packaging design to increase recyclability and initial progress towards ambitious recycled content targets. The report establishes, for the first time, a quantitative baseline that can be used to measure such progress across a significant group of businesses over the period to 2025.

Some communities may be concerned with abandoned vessels, while others, lost fishing gear may be more prevalent. If you live inland, trash in the ocean may not be directly visible, but your community may still have a role in creating the waste that becomes marine debris. Finding solutions that work for your community makes the fight against marine debris more effective. By working together as a community, we can have a larger impact.', 'Under the project, UNEP developed and published reports to map global plastic value chain and propose recommended actions to address hotspots along the value chain, including: 1) the Addressing marine plastics: A systemic approach - Stocktaking report, which takes stock of the extent of knowledge on plastics in the marine environment. 2) the report on “Mapping of global plastics value chain and plastics losses to the environment - with a particular focus on marine environment”, which provides a comprehensive global mapping of plastic losses to the environment throughout the plastic value chain using 2015 as the reference year. 3) a to-be-published 3rd report on recommendations for actions to address marine plastic pollution. 4) a roadmap to circular economy for plastics which provides an action-oriented strategy by identifying a core set of priority solutions to be implemented by targeted stakeholders from the whole plastics value chain under different time horizons, and at different geographical scales.  UNEP also organized 2 multi-stakeholder consultation workshops. Each workshop convened participants across a range of nationalities and stakeholders, including industry, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), not-for-profts (NPOs), regional and national government and intergovernmental organisations from a marine litter background and from a life cycle/circular economy plastics background.   ', 'This guidance incorprate: 1) technical modules which provide a step-by-step approach to better understand the plastic value chain, key sources of leakage and the potential impacts of the leakage; and 2)strategic modules which provide a process to prioritize hotspots and identify context-specific interventions that occur throughout the value chain, including tackling the sources, the use, or the end-of-life of the plastic. The guidance also offers insight on key strategies for stakeholder engagement and identification of appropriate actions to successfully implement the planned interventions.
