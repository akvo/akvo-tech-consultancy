The project is envisaged to be implemented in the following two stages: (i) construction of waste sorting facility that will ensure separation of organic and non-organic fractions with subsequent sorting of non-organic materials and separation of plastic, metals, glass, textile, paper, etc and (ii) construction of organic waste processing facility that will produce biogas or organic fertilizers for agricultural needs.

Through the SGP grant funding, ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools, universities, organizations, companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic, paper, glass, and metallic waste, which will be transported to the recycling sites.  The project allows to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air, water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover, the project will hold different competitions, trainings and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.', 'The  project offers behavioral change initiatives through awareness-raising campaigns, reward mechanisms and behavioral experiments aiming to replace single-use plastic bags with reusable ones.

Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  o\\tThe project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  o\\tThe project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  o\\tThe project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream.

One of the aims was to investigate, through the pilot projects, the feasibility of developing this scheme and to prepare guidelines. The implementation in two fishing ports Hvar and Tribunj show a strong fishermen willingness to collaborate, being aware of their unique role in the active removal of litter from the sea. However, due to a lack of an overarching National law addressing marine litter management, its legal status was not defined. Existing Law on Sustainable Waste Management do not specifies how to handle with the litter collected. More should be in a separate regulation that applies only to marine litter, but it has not been adopted to the present days. Thus, marine litter was temporarily classified as urban waste by the hosting Municipalities and the municipal waste management company was in charge of disposal. Ffl activity can be easily implemented in Croatia, but is necessary to improve the legislation about marine litter, to examine deficiencies and gaps in these policies, and suggesting options for improvement.', '- ongoing provision of technical assistance to Argentina and Mexico on plastics and pollution  - ongoing preparation of a legislative guide on the regulation of single use plastic  ', 'Ban on certain single use plastics underway.
