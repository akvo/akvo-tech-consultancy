",As an individual,,,Yes,1,Fishing for litter,"Fisheries is a sector that can make a significant contribution to solving the problem of the marine litter, by participating in its removal through the ""Fishing for Litter"" (FfL) initiative. This practice relates to the collection of litter from the sea that are caught in the nets during the fishing and its disposal on the shore in communal containers where it is handled within the existing waste management system without reimbursement for fishermen. This report presents the experiences and achievements of the EU ML-REPAIR project in the Croatia that could be used to further develop the litter accumulated on sea bottom disposal initiative in the Croatian part of the Adriatic. One of the project goals is to design new strategies to reduce the marine litter quantities in the Adriatic Sea. Project activities were conceived through the cross-border cooperation of partners from the INTEREG ITA-CRO dealing with the problem of marine litter removing by involving the fisheries sector. These initiatives on the Croatian side of the Adriatic Sea are managed and coordinated by the Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries (IZOR) from Split, one of the partners in the project. The initiative was a reflection of the operational methods of pilot-programs implemented in Western European countries (the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) based on the experiences of KIMO Networks participating in such programs, such as Fishing-for-Litter Scotland.","WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes",,,"Awareness raising and Behaviour change,Education/Training,Workshops",,"Information campaign,Behaviour change campaign/programme,Community Engagement,Stakeholder Engagement",,"Other training programmes,Institutional development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments,MONITORING and ANALYSIS: Collecting evidence around plastic discharge to the ocean/waterways?

One of the aims was to investigate, through the pilot projects, the feasibility of developing this scheme and to prepare guidelines. The implementation in two fishing ports Hvar and Tribunj show a strong fishermen willingness to collaborate, being aware of their unique role in the active removal of litter from the sea. However, due to a lack of an overarching National law addressing marine litter management, its legal status was not defined. Existing Law on Sustainable Waste Management do not specifies how to handle with the litter collected. More should be in a separate regulation that applies only to marine litter, but it has not been adopted to the present days. Thus, marine litter was temporarily classified as urban waste by the hosting Municipalities and the municipal waste management company was in charge of disposal. Ffl activity can be easily implemented in Croatia, but is necessary to improve the legislation about marine litter, to examine deficiencies and gaps in these policies, and suggesting options for improvement.",2020-01-14 12:48:24 UTC,2020-01-14 13:33:37 UTC545728-545719-53855495,,,,,,,,,UNEP,On behalf of an organisation,,UNEP Law Division,Yes,1,"legislative guidance to countries on marine litter, microplastics and single-use plastics",legislative assistance to countries,"LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments.",Legislation or regulations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",We are the funding body,,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),,National ministry/agency,,,,,,Yes,There is a mandatory reporting mechanism,,,,Yes,,Global (it covers the whole world),,"All,Argentina,Mexico",,Other,"lifecycle of pastics (production, distribution, packaging, waste management","All of the above,Other","It depends on the country needs  1) a general global guidance is being developed  2) upon request from countries, there is a gap analysis to identify regulatory gaps so as to provide targeted legal assistance",Other,see comment under Q18,"All of the above,Other",Depends of country needs and priorities,"Macroplastic (large, more than 20 mm, e.g. plastic bottles),Microplastics (tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, e.g., found in personal care products/synthetic textiles)",,"All of the above,Other",Depends on country needs and priorities,Other,Depends on country needs and priorities,"Packaging,Textiles,Transportation,Food & Beverages,Personal Healthcare,Wastewater/Sewage management,Other","Mainly the sectors checked, but it depends on country needs and priorities.",150000,USD,50000,USD,Voluntary donations,,,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/legal-limits-single-use-plastics-and-microplastics,,,,,,- ongoing provision of technical assistance to Argentina and Mexico on plastics and pollution  - ongoing preparation of a legislative guide on the regulation of single use plastic  ,2020-01-14 13:15:32 UTC,2020-01-14 14:43:51 UTC545728-545719-53915703,,,,,,,,,National Geographic Society ,On behalf of an organisation,,National Geographic Society,Yes,2,'Sea to Source: Ganges' Expedition ,"The “Sea to Source: Ganges” river expeditions mobilize a global community of experts to help tackle the global problem of plastic pollution.

Through the SGP grant funding, ISSD NGO plans to install 300 sorting bins in 50 entities including schools, universities, organizations, companies and 10 publicly available collection points for plastic, paper, glass, and metallic waste, which will be transported to the recycling sites.  The project allows to decrease the amount of recyclable waste in landfills by boosting recycling of 4 types of solid waste. This will primarily contribute to reduction of hazardous emissions caused by open burning in backyards and landfills causing air, water and soil pollution; biodiversity loss; and human health hazards. Moreover, the project will hold different competitions, trainings and public events for various stakeholders to raise awareness about adverse effect of improper waste handling. These activities will also promote separation and collection of additional recyclable waste.","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,Change in practice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",I/We are implementing it,,"THIRD SECTOR (e.g. non-governmental and non-profit-making organisations, including charity groups, community groups etc).",,,,,,Community based organisation,,Yes,There is a mandatory reporting mechanism,,,,Yes,,National (it covers one entire country),,Armenia,,"Urban environment,Waste disposal sites",,"Collection / sorting of plastics after use,Management of collected plastics",,"Reducing plastics,Recycling plastics",,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Other,Waste,50000,USD,16730,USD,Mixed,,GEF SGP,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,"""https://www.facebook.com/issdngo/ (ISSD NGO FB page)    http://www.slaq.am/arm/news/1262611/ (SLAQ Article in Armenian)    https://econews.am/?p=10501&l=am (Article at econews.am)    https://bit.ly/2rV0bBa (H1 TV reportage)  https://bit.ly/2QSJPbc (AR TV Azdarar reportage)    https://bit.ly/2DRdclU (Yerevan Municipality joins “Recycle it” program for waste diversion and recycling)    https://bit.ly/2wOYqYF (ISSD project documentary_ Arm with English subtitles)""",,,,,,,2020-01-23 20:24:56 UTC,2020-01-23 20:40:49 UTC545728-545719-54237211,,,,,,,,,UNDP,On behalf of an organisation,,UNDP,"No, I am returning to the survey to report on additional actions/activities",,My Step Charitable Foundation,"The  project offers behavioral change initiatives through awareness-raising campaigns, reward mechanisms and behavioral experiments aiming to replace single-use plastic bags with reusable ones.

The use of non-incineration technologies also provide for the opportunity to recycle disinfected waste fractions, in particular plastics, and allow model healthcare facilities in project countries to reduce their costs for waste treatment, by selling plastics to recyclers. Examples from project countries on engagement with plastics recycling industry are as follows:  o	The project in Madagascar has implemented the collection of recyclable plastics at all five model healthcare facilities (HFCs) and facilitated HFC’s engagement with recycling companies in Antananarivo. The university hospital in Antananarivo, CHU JRB Befelatanana, currently produces pavers from recycling of disinfected (autoclaved) plastics.  o	The project in Tanzania focuses on the recycling of plastic that was previously infectious, rather than recovering recyclable materials from the general waste stream. All five model HCFs in Dar es Salaam produces blocks of disinfected plastics. The project identified a plastic recycling facility in Mbagala that will collect the plastic blocks from the HCFs, including Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, and transport these to their sorting facility; the facilities will receive 500 TSH per kg for plastic (0.22 USD/kg).  o	The project in Zambia already initiated recycling activities by recovering recyclable plastics from the general waste stream. The local recycling company, Waste Master (Z), currently works with three model HFCs in Lusaka, University Teaching Hospital (UTH), Chilenje and Matero Level 1 Hospitals. The model HCFs supplying Waste Master (Z) in Lusaka receive about 1.15 kwacha per kg of mixed plastics (0.08 USD/kg).   o	In Zambia, the project also initiated a demonstration activity, as an example of closed loop recycling of plastic waste, on the local production of high quality sharp waste containers from recycled plastics from disinfected plastics from model HFCs in Lusaka, but the activity was cancelled due to high cost proposals from private sector.","TECHNOLOGY and PROCESSES: New technical developments/innovation (e.g., research and development, new product design, new materials, processes etc.) changes in practice, operations, environmental management and planning.",,,,,,,,,,,Change in operations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",I/We are implementing it,,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),,National ministry/agency,,,,,,Yes,Reporting is voluntary,,,,Yes,,Regional (UN Regions),,"Ghana,Madagascar,United Republic of Tanzania,Zambia",,"Urban environment,Waste disposal sites",,Collection / sorting of plastics after use,,Recycling plastics,,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Medical,,6453195,USD,28936164,USD,Not applicable,,GEF,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,I have no link to provide,,,,,,,2020-01-23 20:48:23 UTC,2020-01-23 20:56:14 UTC545728-545719-54237727,,,,,,,,,UNDP,On behalf of an organisation,,UNDP,"No, I am returning to the survey to report on additional actions/activities",,Sound Chemicals Management Mainstreaming and UPOPs reduction in Kenya,"Two main initiatives:   o	The project contributed to the consultations, planning and discussions around the Government’s decision to ban plastic bags, which has brought a significant reduction in UPOPs reduction  o	The project aims to support, as part of the municipal waste management, initiatives of plastics management / recycling.","LEGISLATION, STANDARDS, RULES: e.g. agreeing new or changing rules or standards that others should comply with, new regulation, agreements, policies, economic instruments etc. including voluntary commitments.",Policy change or development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WORKING WITH PEOPLE: Encouraging or enabling others (e.g., education, training, communication, awareness raising, behaviour change programmes)",I/We are implementing it,,PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (organisations concerned with government policies and programmes),,National ministry/agency,,,,,,Yes,Reporting is voluntary,,,,Yes,,National (it covers one entire country),,Kenya,,Urban environment,,"Use / consumption,Collection / sorting of plastics after use",,"Reducing plastics,Recycling plastics",,Human health and wellbeing,,Not applicable,,,,,,Packaging,,4515000,USD,21000000,USD,"Public Financing,Mixed",,GEF,Continuous activity more than 3 Years long,,I have no links to provide,,,,,,,2020-01-23 20:56:23 UTC,2020-01-23 21:02:37 UTC545728-545719-54237935,,,,,,,,,UNDP,On behalf of an organisation,,UNDP,"No, I am returning to the survey to report on additional actions/activities",,Developing the community-based plastic waste management in coastal areas of Ha Long Bay Quang Ninh province,"The project is aimed at engaging local communities and relevant stakeholders in the coastal areas of Ha Long Bay to participate volunteerly and actively in collecting plastic waste and mitigating environmental pollution from plastic waste in Ha Long Bay     Specific project activities include:  -	Raising the community’s awareness on plastic waste (PW); enhancing the capacity of local communities and relevant stakeholders  on PW management, separation, collection and processing; changing behaviors in using plastic products.  -	Contributing to the reduction of PW and environmental pollution by implementing various demonstration of plastic waste collection groups, self-managed groups of plastic waste collection and separation at source by 3R criteria (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle)   -	Developing policy recommendations  in management, mitigation and disposal of plastic waste.
