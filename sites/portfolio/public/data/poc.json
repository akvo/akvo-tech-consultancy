            "The involvement of NGOs and multilateral organizations in the development of country ICT systems must ultimately be aimed at strengthening government data systems. On a country scale, systems alignment, consolidation, and the avoidance of software fragmentation is a prime goal towards the strengthening of the data management system. Such systems need to have an adequate institutional embedding, geared towards their long-term stability.",
            "Systems such as Akvo Flow (and others such as Kobo Toolbox, ODK, and RedCap), are mainly geared towards data capture using forms in a flexible and adaptable way. However, there currently is a disconnect between the flexibility of these dedicated tools, and the need for adequate long-term storage in a well-structured domain-specific government data store. The challenge then is to curate the stream of data generated by such systems for ultimate storage in the central government system.",
            "As a practical example, consider the management of water points. A government agency might use Akvo Flow to organize a nation-wide data collection survey on the location and status of water points. Ideally, a standardized survey would be used, but in many cases a custom survey will be produced and used. Once the data is collected, it will be analyzed and a report will be written, which will be the basis for policy decisions. There is a good chance that the data will stay in Excel format from this moment on, unless there is a country system in place that is charged with the long-term storing and making accessible water point data. If such a system is in place, it will have a data structure that captures the relevant data for the waterpoint over the years. The process of getting the data from the project-based system into the central database can, and often is, manual. In more advanced setups, this can be an automatic integration.",
